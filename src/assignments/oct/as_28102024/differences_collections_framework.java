    Difference between arraylist and linked list
             Array List                                                        Linked List
   In terms of storing the elements                                      In terms of storing the elements
      ArrayList uses dynamic arrays to store the elements                LinkedList uses doubly linked list to store the elements
    In terms of manipulation                                             In terms of manipulation
       Arraylist is slower as it internally uses the arrays to           LinkedList is faster as it uses a doubly linked list
       store the element                                                 so bit shifting is required in the memory
     In terms of usage                                                   In terms of usage
     ArrayList is better for storing and accessing elements               LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
     ArrayList class can act as List interface.                           LinkedList class can act as both list and queue as it
                                                                          implements both list and deque interfaces.
